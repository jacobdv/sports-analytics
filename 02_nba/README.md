# Overview
This has been my tertiary sport of analytic interest and that is well reflected in the amount of content contained here. My analysis was primarily looking at individual players, typically retired so that the stats didn't need to be updated constantly. This is generating summary statistics for the most part. In the team folder, I had the beginnings of starting to do team analysis with the idea of looking at standard deviation and variance for a variety of stats that contribute to scoring to get the likelyhood that a team would score x amount on any given night. With my current programming and analytical tools, this may be more realistic to take another look into than it was at the time when I was working exclusively in Excel.
