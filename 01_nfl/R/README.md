# Overview
This directory will go away shortly as projects are categorized. At the moment, it is simply the unplaced R scripts that I was exploring with. It includes data from 2000-2021, which does take a minute to load in and process, but is then a great dataset to get to explore. The comebacks.R file looks at each play for that span of years and calculates the point differential at that play, as well as the final point differential, to determine if there was a comeback greater than or equal to the points specified by the user. 
Interestingly, of the three largest comebacks since 2000, two were in the playoffs: New England over Atlanta in Super Bowl LI (25 points) and Indianapolis over Kansas City in the 2013-2014 Wild Card Round (28 points). The other was Cleveland over Tennessee in Week 5 of the 2014 season (25 points).
