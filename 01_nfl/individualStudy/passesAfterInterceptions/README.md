# Overview
As mentioned in the parent README, passes after interceptions tell us a lot about the quarterback, and hopefully the playcaller in some cases, though this would be more telling if we looked at the first offensive play rather than the first pass. League average completion percentage, target depth, and yards gained may all be impacted.

# Hypotheses
I would expect a top tier group of quarterbacks to be unaffected in terms of their completion percentage after an earlier interception. In veterans, I could even see an argument for a higher completion percentage after a pick, as their pass selection may be focused more on getting back into a rhythm. However, in young and inexperienced quarterbacks, I would expect completion percentage to drop slightly, though veteran playcallers may also play a role here in pass selection. <br /><br />
Across the board, I expect league average target depth and yards gained to be lower than the average for all passes when the previous throw was an interception.
